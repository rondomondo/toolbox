# pdf-strip

Strips all metadata from PDF files. Removes both the legacy `/Info` dictionary (Author, Title, Producer, CreationDate, etc.) and the XMP metadata stream embedded in `/Root/Metadata`.

Running `pdf-strip <file>` strips metadata by default and writes `<base>.stripped.pdf` alongside the original. Use `--check` to inspect any found metadata without modifying.

> **Also available as an [Agent Skill](#claude-code-skill)** -- install it to strip PDF metadata directly from Claude Code with no terminal required. Use the `/pdf-strip` slash command or just describe what you want and your AI Agent will handle it.

<summary><b>Why strip PDF metadata anyway?</b>
</summary>
<br>
When you share a PDF, you may be sharing a lot more than you realise. PDF files carry hidden metadata embedded by the tools that created them — invisible to readers but trivially extracted by anyone who knows to look. None of it is obvious in the document 

**What gets embedded:**

- **Provenance** — `Author`, `Creator`, and XMP fields record who made the document and which software was used (`Adobe Acrobat 23.1`, `Microsoft Word 2019`). Tool version information is handy for attackers scoping known vulnerabilities.
- **Revision history** — `CreationDate`, `ModDate`, and XMP revision counts expose your drafting timeline — when work started, how many rounds it went through, and when it was finalised.
- **Contributors** — collaborative tools (Google Docs exports, Office 365) can silently embed every editor and reviewer who touched the file.
- **Internal paths** — some applications write the original save location into XMP (e.g. `\\fileserver\confidential\Q3-board-pack.docx`), leaking internal naming conventions, folder structures, and server names.
- **Organisation details** — `Company`, `Keywords`, subject classifications, and Dublin Core fields can surface internal project names, team structures, or sensitivity labels that were never intended for outside eyes.
- **macOS extended attributes** — Apple's Finder and Spotlight silently tag files with `xattr` blobs including `com.apple.quarantine` and `com.apple.metadata:kMDItemWhereFroms` (the URL a file was downloaded from). These travel with the file when shared and can reveal source systems or download origin.

Stripping this before sharing is good practice: it reduces unintentional disclosure, limits what can be inferred about your environment, and produces smaller files.

**Not sure what's hiding in a file?** Run `pdf-strip --check <file>` first — it prints everything embedded so you can see exactly what you'd be sharing.

## Quickstart

> 💡 Prerequisite: Have you a [`test PDF file`] with metadata to try?

```bash
docker run --rm ghcr.io/rondomondo/pdf-strip install
```

### Install from the ghcr.io image

Using the pre-built [`docker image`] available at [`ghcr.io/rondomondo/pdf-strip`] run these steps

```bash
setopt interactivecomments

# 1. Stream the pdf-strip wrapper script to disk and make it executable
docker run --rm ghcr.io/rondomondo/pdf-strip:latest install > pdf-strip && chmod +x pdf-strip

# 2. Install it system-wide
install -m 755 pdf-strip /usr/local/bin/pdf-strip

# 3. get a PDF with metadata to test with (if we don't already have one)
EXAMPLE_PDF=test/example.pdf
EXAMPLE_STRIPPED_PDF=test/example.stripped.pdf

! test -e "$EXAMPLE_PDF" && curl --silent -L --create-dirs -o "${EXAMPLE_PDF}" https://abcdef.ai/$EXAMPLE_PDF

# 4. run pdf-strip to strip this test PDF file (default behaviour)
pdf-strip "$EXAMPLE_PDF"

# 5. check the PDF file size before stripping
printf "$(wc -c < ${EXAMPLE_PDF}) bytes in ${EXAMPLE_PDF} before stripping" 

# 6. check the PDF file size after stripping - should be less
printf "$(wc -c < ${EXAMPLE_STRIPPED_PDF}) bytes in ${EXAMPLE_PDF} after stripping" 

```


### Install and use from the github repository
Clone the github project repository, build and install etc., it locally with these steps

```bash
setopt interactivecomments

# 1. Clone the toolbox repo which has the pdf-strip tool
git clone https://github.com/rondomondo/toolbox.git && cd toolbox/pdf-strip

# 2. install the `pdf-strip` tool to /usr/local/bin
make install

# 3. run pdf-strip to strip this test PDF file (default behaviour)
EXAMPLE_PDF=test/example.pdf
EXAMPLE_STRIPPED_PDF=test/example.stripped.pdf

pdf-strip "$EXAMPLE_PDF"

# 4. check the PDF file size before stripping
printf "$(wc -c < ${EXAMPLE_PDF}) bytes in ${EXAMPLE_PDF} before stripping" 

# 5. check the PDF file size after stripping - should be less
printf "$(wc -c < ${EXAMPLE_STRIPPED_PDF}) bytes in ${EXAMPLE_PDF} after stripping" 

```

> 💡 Tip: Once the `pdf-strip` tool has been installed it will take care of pulling any docker images it needs.


## Usage

Here are a few examples of how to use this tool. 

```sh
pdf-strip example.pdf                              # strip metadata (default)
pdf-strip *.pdf                                    # strip multiple files
pdf-strip ./my-docs/                               # strip all PDFs in a directory (recursive)
pdf-strip --check example.pdf                      # check for metadata without stripping
pdf-strip --check ./my-docs/                       # check all PDFs in a directory
```

When using the Claude Code skill, you can also pass a URL directly and Claude will fetch the file for you:

```
/pdf-strip https://alertstack.io/pdf-strip/test/example.pdf
/pdf-strip --check https://alertstack.io/pdf-strip/test/example.pdf
```

Output is written alongside each original file as `<base>.stripped.pdf`. Originals are never modified.

## How it works

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `strip.py` | Core Python script. Opens a PDF with pikepdf, deletes the `/Info` dict and the XMP `/Root/Metadata` stream, writes a clean copy. |
| `entrypoint.sh` | Container entrypoint. Handles `install` dispatch, then delegates to `strip.py` with the supplied arguments. |
| `install.sh` | Bundled inside the image. Run via `docker run ... install` to copy the `pdf-strip` wrapper script to your host. |
| `pdf-strip` | Host-side wrapper script. Handles Docker plumbing: validates inputs, copies files into a temp dir, runs the container, and copies results back next to each original. |
| `Dockerfile` | Builds a minimal `python:3.12-slim` image with pikepdf and bundles all scripts. |
| `Makefile` | Developer workflow: build/tag/push image, run strips, install wrapper. |

## pdf-strip wrapper usage

```
pdf-strip                           Show help
pdf-strip -h | --help               Show help
pdf-strip <file.pdf>                Strip one PDF (default)
pdf-strip <f1.pdf> <f2.pdf>        Strip multiple PDFs
pdf-strip <directory>               Strip every .pdf found recursively
pdf-strip --check <file.pdf>        Check for metadata, print findings
pdf-strip --check <directory>       Check every .pdf found recursively
pdf-strip -- [args...]              Pass args directly to the container entrypoint
```

When invoked via the Claude Code skill, a URL is also accepted as input -- Claude fetches the
file and then strips or checks it:

```
/pdf-strip https://alertstack.io/pdf-strip/test/example.pdf
/pdf-strip --check https://alertstack.io/pdf-strip/test/example.pdf
```

### Modes

| Flag | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| _(none)_ | Strip metadata and write `<base>.stripped.pdf` alongside each original |
| `--check` | Print any metadata found (or none); exit 1 if any found |

### Environment variables

| Variable | Values | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `PDF_STRIP_IMAGE` | image reference | Override the Docker image (default: `ghcr.io/rondomondo/pdf-strip:latest`) |
| `DEBUG` | `true`/`1`, `false`/`0` | Enable verbose logging in both the wrapper and the container entrypoint |

```sh
# strip metadata (default)
pdf-strip report.pdf

# check for metadata without stripping
pdf-strip --check report.pdf

# override image
PDF_STRIP_IMAGE=ghcr.io/rondomondo/pdf-strip:0.0.3 pdf-strip report.pdf
```

---

### Open an interactive shell

```sh
make docker-shell
# or
docker run --rm -it \
  -v "$(pwd):/data" \
  --entrypoint /bin/bash \
  ghcr.io/rondomondo/pdf-strip:latest
```

---

## Make targets

```
make help                Show all targets

# Build
make docker-build        Build the image locally
make docker-tag          Retag for REGISTRY (default ghcr.io)
make docker-push         Push versioned + :latest to REGISTRY
make docker-release      Build, tag, and push in one step
make docker-ensure       Pull image from ghcr.io if not present; fall back to local build

# Run
make docker-shell        Open an interactive shell in the container

# Install
make install             Install pdf-strip wrapper to /usr/local/bin
make uninstall           Remove pdf-strip from /usr/local/bin

# Cleanup
make clean               Remove local Docker images (calls docker-clean)
```

Override registry, directories or tag:

```sh
make docker-release REGISTRY=docker.io
make docker-build PDF_STRIP_IMAGE_TAG=0.0.4
make run DATA=/path/to/pdfs
```

## What gets removed

| Metadata store | Fields |
|---|---|
| `/Info` dictionary | Author, Title, Subject, Keywords, Creator, Producer, CreationDate, ModDate |
| `/Root/Metadata` XMP stream | Dublin Core, XMP, XMP Rights, PDF namespaces |

## Claude Code skill

<details>
<summary>Install the <code>/pdf-strip</code> slash command for Claude Code</summary>

This repository ships a `/pdf-strip` slash command skill for [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)
that lets Claude strip PDF metadata directly -- no terminal required. Just describe what you want
and Claude will invoke the skill automatically.

### What it accepts

| Input | Example |
|---|---|
| Single file | `report.pdf` |
| Multiple files | `file1.pdf file2.pdf` |
| Directory | `./my-docs/` |
| URL | `https://example.com/report.pdf` |
| Check mode | `--check report.pdf` |

### Invoking the skill

Use the slash command directly:

```
/pdf-strip report.pdf
/pdf-strip --check report.pdf
/pdf-strip ./my-docs/
/pdf-strip https://example.com/report.pdf
```

Or just describe what you want in natural language -- Claude will invoke the skill automatically:

> *"Strip the metadata from this PDF before I share it"*
>
> *"Check what's hidden in report.pdf"*
>
> *"Clean all the PDFs in my-docs/"*
>
> *"Fetch this PDF from the URL and strip its metadata"*

### Installing the skill

#### Option A -- sync locally via `make`

```bash
# from inside the pdf-strip directory
make sync-skill
```

This syncs `pdf-strip`, `SKILL.md`, and `README.md` to:

```
~/Code/agent-skills-toolbox/skills/pdf-strip/
```

Override the target directory with `SKILLS_DIR`:

```bash
make sync-skill SKILLS_DIR=/path/to/your/project/.claude/skills/pdf-strip
```

#### Option B -- copy manually

```bash
mkdir -p .claude/skills/pdf-strip
cp pdf-strip SKILL.md README.md .claude/skills/pdf-strip/
```
